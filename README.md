This project explores and compares different shortest path algorithms, focusing on Dijkstraâ€™s and Bellman-Ford algorithms, and investigates the A* algorithm as a more advanced alternative. Our goal is to implement these algorithms and analyze their performance in various scenarios to gain insights into their efficiency and practical applications. We aim to understand the trade-offs between different algorithms and determine which is best suited for specific types of problems.
